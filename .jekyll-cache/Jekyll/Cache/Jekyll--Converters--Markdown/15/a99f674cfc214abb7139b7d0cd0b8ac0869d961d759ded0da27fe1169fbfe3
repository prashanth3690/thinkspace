I"‹<p>This is April 2021 and here we are again, Locked down due to Covid in Bangalore.
This means Iâ€™m going to have a lot of time on my hands post work and moreover a lot of energy that I need to focus on something.</p>

<p>I had been reading a bit obout fermentation and the idea of a home-brew Kombucha stuck with me.</p>

<p>Getting the SCOBY and the started kombucha was a bit of a pain during the lockdown.</p>

<p>Next best thing? That I could do with all the ingredients at home? - Ginger Ale/Beer !â€¨
Process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ginger Bug - This is the starter that culture that ferments the entire batch.</li>
  <li>1st Ferment - The batch is fermented using the ginger bug. Play with flavours here.</li>
  <li>2nd Ferment - All about Carbonation ! Getting that CO2 infused in the brew.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For the Ginger bug - 300ml
    <ul>
      <li>Chopped Fresh Ginger (irradiated/organic) - 1.5 Tbsp x per day for 3 days. = ~5 Tbsp</li>
      <li>White Granulated Sugar - 1.5 Tbsp x per day for 3 days. = ~5 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Filtered Water (Chlorine-Free) - 300ml</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For the brew - 2 litres
    <ul>
      <li>Filtered Water (Chlorine-Free) - 2 Liters</li>
      <li>Chopped Fresh Ginger (irradiated/organic) - 3 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Lime Juice - 20ml</li>
      <li>White Granulated Sugar - 1/4 cup</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Recipe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ginger Bug
    <ul>
      <li>Take a pint size glass jar with 300 ml of filtered water. Make sure that it is chlorine free to encourage the microbes the develop in the starter.</li>
      <li>Add the 1.5tbsp of chopped up ginger (with the skin on preferably but washed of course)</li>
      <li>Add the 1.5tbsp of sugar and stir it up. Make sure to not use a metal spoon but a plastic or a wood one. (Metal kills any good bacteria in the starter)</li>
      <li>Close it lightly with the lid or cover it with a cheese cloth/coffee filter and a rubber band</li>
      <li>Add 1 tbsp of ginger and sugar everyday and stirring it</li>
      <li>Usually takes 3 days to notice good amount of bubble activity in the jar (in a warm weather)
