This is April 2021 and here we are again, Locked down due to Covid in Bangalore.
This means I’m going to have a some time on my hands post work.
I had been reading a bit obout fermentation and the idea of a home-brew Kombucha stuck with me.

Getting the SCOBY and the started kombucha was a bit of a pain during the lockdown.

Next best thing? That I could do with all the ingredients at home? - Ginger Ale/Beer ! 
Process:
1. Ginger Bug - This is the starter that culture that ferments the entire batch.
2. 1st Ferment - The batch is fermented using the ginger bug. Play with flavours here.
3. 2nd Ferment - All about Carbonation ! Getting that CO2 infused in the brew.

Ingredients:
1. For the Ginger bug - 300ml
    * Chopped Fresh Ginger (irradiated/organic) - 1.5 Tbsp x per day for 3 days. = ~5 Tbsp
    * White Granulated Sugar - 1.5 Tbsp x per day for 3 days. = ~5 Tbsp
    * Filtered Water (Chlorine-Free) - 300ml
2. For the brew - 2 litres
    * Filtered Water (Chlorine-Free) - 2 Liters
    * Chopped Fresh Ginger (irradiated/organic) - 3 Tbsp
    * Lime Juice - 20ml
    * White Granulated Sugar - 1/4 cup

Recipe:

1. Ginger Bug
    * Take a pint size glass jar with 300 ml of filtered water. Make sure that it is chlorine free to encourage the microbes the develop in the starter.
    * Add the 1.5tbsp of chopped up ginger (with the skin on preferably but washed of course)
    * Add the 1.5tbsp of sugar and stir it up. Make sure to not use a metal spoon but a plastic or a wood one. (Metal kills any good bacteria in the starter)
    * Close it lightly with the lid or cover it with a cheese cloth/coffee filter and a rubber band
    * Add 1 tbsp of ginger and sugar everyday and stirring it
    * Usually takes 3 days to notice good amount of bubble activity in the jar (in a warm weather)
    *
